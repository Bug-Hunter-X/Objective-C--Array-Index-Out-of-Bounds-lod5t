This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an element beyond the array's valid index range.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected code and explains how to avoid this error.  This is a crucial concept for ensuring robust and stable Objective-C applications.  Always check array bounds before accessing elements to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior.
