This code attempts to access an array element outside its bounds.  The `myArray` only has 5 elements, but the loop tries to access index 5 which is out of bounds leading to a crash or unexpected behavior. 
```objectivec
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@1, @2, @3, @4, @5, nil];

for (int i = 0; i <= [myArray count]; i++) {
    NSLog (@"Element at index %d: %@", i, [myArray objectAtIndex:i]);
}
```
